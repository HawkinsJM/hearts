# Posthearts.chat

## Description
This is a web animation that visualizes a html transcript of a chatango chatroom. The goal was to pull the chat enteries from the end of a program the participants of the chat were listening to. During the program the users often post hearts, so hearts were visualized in a different manner from other text. 

The visualization displays the text and hearts as they were post in real-time in the chatroom having them float up the screen. The music from the end of the program is played too. 

## Technology
The HTML was parsed in a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas and Beautiful Soup.

The visualization was created in p5.js, CSS and HTML. 

This respoitory is the site that is live at posthearts.chat. It is being hosted by github.
